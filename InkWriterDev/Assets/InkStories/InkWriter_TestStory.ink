PLAYER(left, nohat) This is on the left, also I have a portrait sans hat.

PLAYER(right, hat) And this is on the right. I have a hat portrait.

~trackableVariable++
This is probably also on the right. Also I just increased a variable +1! It is now {trackableVariable}!

PLAYER(left, hat) Then this is on the left again. I added a hat.

+(option1) [This is an option that is always here.]
PLAYER(left, nohat) Great. Hat off!

PLAYER(right, nohat) Good idea!

+(option2) [{IsInteractable(RANDOM(0,1)>0)}This is an option that is sometimes disabled.]
PLAYER(left, nohat) Lucky us. Off with the hat.

PLAYER(right, nohat) Yass.

Hi there. This is set in the other scene, just to show how easily variables and things carry over.

In the previous scene, we increased trackableVariable to {trackableVariable}. Nice.

In the previous scene, we picked option 1 {start.option1} times and option 2 {start.option2} times. Neat!

Welp, that was that. Let's load the other scene back.

+ [Load me back, Scotty! LOAD_SCENE(SampleScene)]
[This text won't be visible.]

Okely, fine by me.
